I was really excited to read the book fully dedicated to the role of Staff Engineer. As someone who aspires to grow into this role, I found Tanya Reilly's insights are valuable.

However, book also left me with mixed feelings. While some chapters were incredibly insightful, others felt less relevant to my current understanding of the role. I also want to notice that I find book unnecessary long and repetitive in some parts. Some chapters could be shortened or even omitted without losing much value.
